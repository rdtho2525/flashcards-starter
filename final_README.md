# Flashcards

## Introduction
_Flashcards_ is a command line game that helps users quiz themselves on key web development terms and concepts.  The server will ask the user a question and provide _3 possible answers_.  The user can choose an answer by cycling through the provided options using the `up`/`down` arrow keys or by entering the answer's corresponding number. Pressing `enter` to submit the user's guess and return immediate feedback on whether that answer is correct.  When the round is complete, the user will receive their final percentage score of correct answers.
